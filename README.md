Human Development Analysis & Visualization
A data analysis and visualization project using Power BI & Python — created as part of my AI studies at Johannes Kepler University (JKU).

This project explores global development trends using the UNDP Human Development Report dataset. It focuses on extracting meaningful insights from complex indicators like HDI, GII, and GNIPC through interactive visualizations and data-driven hypotheses.

🎯 Project Goals
Apply real-world data analysis and visualization techniques.

Explore relationships between education, economic growth, and gender inequality.

Gain hands-on experience with large, real-world datasets in a structured analytical workflow.

Translate complex indicators into accessible visual stories for decision-makers.

📊 Tools & Skills Demonstrated
Python (Pandas, Plotly Express) – Data wrangling and interactive visualizations

Power BI – Key influencers, scatter plots, and multi-dimensional dashboards

Data Preprocessing – Handling missing values, correcting misclassifications, transforming data

Statistical Thinking – Hypothesis-driven analysis and trend comparison

Storytelling with Data – Communicating insights clearly and effectively

🔍 Key Analyses & Visualizations
1. USA vs. South Korea – Economic Recovery After Crises
Compared LFPR and GNIPC over time (1990–2020)

Dual-axis line chart visualized economic resilience post-1997 and 2008 crises

2. HDI vs. GII Correlation in Asia
Used Power BI's Key Influencers to identify drivers of gender inequality

Scatter plots showed inverse relationships between HDI and GII across Asian countries

3. Impact of Education on Income Growth
Explored how Mean Years of Schooling affects GNIPC after 15 years

Animated scatter plot illustrated development trends over time across regions

📌 Key Insights
Higher HDI often corresponds with lower GII, especially in East Asia.

Education is a strong predictor of long-term income growth, though regional variations exist.

Power BI's analytical tools revealed nuanced insights behind development metrics.

🤖 Why This Project Matters (for AI & Data Roles)
It demonstrates my ability to work with structured and unstructured data, perform exploratory analysis, and present results in a business-friendly way.

The project reflects how AI and data analytics can contribute to solving global challenges by uncovering patterns in development, inequality, and economic progress.

It showcases my readiness for real-world data problems—from cleaning and modeling to presenting and interpreting.

📈 What's Next
Add regression-based trend lines and predictive modeling (HDI/GII forecasting).

Integrate Power BI dashboards with live datasets via API.

Explore regional NLP-based text mining on UNDP policy descriptions.
