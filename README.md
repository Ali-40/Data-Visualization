# Human Development Analysis & Visualization

**A data analysis and visualization project using Power BI & Python — created as part of my AI studies at Johannes Kepler University (JKU).**

This project explores global development trends using the **UNDP Human Development Report dataset**. It focuses on extracting meaningful insights from complex indicators like HDI, GII, and GNIPC through **interactive visualizations** and **data-driven hypotheses**.

## Project Goals

- Apply real-world data analysis and visualization techniques  
- Explore relationships between education, economic growth, and gender inequality  
- Gain hands-on experience with large, real-world datasets in a structured analytical workflow  
- Translate complex indicators into accessible visual stories for decision-makers  

---

## Tools & Skills Demonstrated

- **Python (Pandas, Plotly Express)** – Data wrangling and interactive visualizations  
- **Power BI** – Key influencers, scatter plots, and multi-dimensional dashboards  
- **Data Preprocessing** – Handling missing values, correcting misclassifications, transforming data  
- **Statistical Thinking** – Hypothesis-driven analysis and trend comparison  
- **Storytelling with Data** – Communicating insights clearly and effectively

## Key Analyses & Visualizations

### 1. USA vs. South Korea – Economic Recovery After Crises  
- Compared **Labor Force Participation Rate (LFPR)** and **Gross National Income per Capita (GNIPC)**  
- Dual-axis line chart visualized economic resilience post-1997 and 2008 crises  

### 2. HDI vs. GII Correlation in Asia  
- Used Power BI's **Key Influencers** to identify drivers of gender inequality  
- Scatter plots showed inverse relationships between HDI and GII across Asian countries  

### 3. Impact of Education on Income Growth  
- Explored how **Mean Years of Schooling (MYS)** affects GNIPC after 15 years  
- Created animated scatter plots to visualize long-term growth trends  

---

## Key Insights

- **Higher HDI often corresponds with lower GII**, especially in East Asia  
- **Education is a strong predictor of long-term income growth**, though regional variations exist  
- **Power BI's analytical tools** revealed nuanced insights behind development metrics

## Relevance to AI & Data Roles

This project showcases:

- My ability to work with structured and unstructured data  
- Proficiency in performing exploratory analysis and building visual dashboards  
- How **AI and data analytics** can help address global challenges by identifying patterns in development, inequality, and economic trends  
- My readiness for real-world data problems, from **cleaning and modeling** to **presenting and interpreting**

## Future Enhancements

- Add regression-based trend lines and predictive modeling (HDI/GII forecasting)  
- Integrate Power BI dashboards with live datasets via API  
- Use NLP to extract and analyze insights from UNDP policy documents  


## Dataset Source

The dataset is provided by the [United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)](https://hdr.undp.org/data-center/human-development-index#/indicies/HDI) and includes decades of data across various human development indicators.
